        <div class = "team__corporate__title">Senior Frontend Developer</div>
        <div class="team__text">Richard’s focus is on the experiential and practical applications of technology. He brings a strong understanding of psychology and human perception to his projects, backed by over a decade of experience developing in over a dozen languages across every discipline from websites to videogames to computer vision.  The breadth of Richard’s experiences allows him to approach problems with an open mind and an adaptable attitude.<br>
          Richard has worked with Asp, C#, Python, Ruby, C++, PHP, Java, Objective C, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, OpenGL, DirectX, OpenCV and all manner of proprietary scripting languages. If you name some language, it’ll turn out he has probably worked with it at some point. From AI for recognizing dogs and cats in photos to beat Google's bot detection, to administrating UofL's super computers, to developing an online store/inventory management system for a Hallmark franchise from the ground up. His experience in such a diverse range of fields and technologies is rare. It allows Richard to approach problems without the functional-fixedness that many developers find themselves shackled by.</div>
