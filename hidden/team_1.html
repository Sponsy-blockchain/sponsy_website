          <div class="team__text">Dan Vail is a highly experienced software expert, who have occupied leading positions in big corporations like Experian, Credit Suisse Bank, Acxiom and others. He has an ability to optimize every aspect of database performance, including hardware implementation, schema design, index optimization, physical hardware placement of SQL objects.<br>
            Dan began with his first computer, a Timex Sinclair 1000 at age 9. He started to take an interest and was writing software in the BASIC programming language for that machine the same year. Ever since, Dan has written software both as a passion and hobby, but also as a way to earn a living.<br>
            Danâ€™s first job in the industry was automating preliminary title investigation reporting for insurance companies with Pentium I computers running FoxPro for Acxiom, the largest data warehouse in the world. He was part of the team that took title insurance companies from microfiche to SQL Server and object oriented front ends at age 20.<br>
            This progressed until Dan chose to accept a position as Chief Information Officer for Seattle Lab at age 24. Dan managed all marketing, accounting, and database activity for an internet software company. The experience afforded him a steep learning curve and the ability to grow personally and professionally. During his tenure there Dan was asked to speak at the Harvard Business School presenting technologies for the new millennium.<br>
            Later on, Dan accepted a position with Experian, the largest credit reporting agency in the world. As a senior engineer in the anti-money laundering division Dan was able to absorb a great deal of knowledge with the United States Department of The Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control compliance laws as well as international banking procedures.<br>
          The last position Dan held was for Credit Suisse Bank. He authored applications that allowed for the servicing of 2 billion in cash and 20 billion in insurance policies. Dan was the sole engineer on the project authoring both SQL back ends and ASP.NET front ends.</div>
