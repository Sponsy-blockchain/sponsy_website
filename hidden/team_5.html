        <div class="team__text">Chris Bouchard is a creative coach and a sponsorship expert who helps artists and non-profits position themselves for success and realize their full potential. Chris is responsible for organizing Sponsyâ€™s operational activity and long-term plans.<br>
          An accomplished grant writer and fundraising consultant, he started his business in 2013 to help small non-profits through the sometimes-overwhelming prospect of navigating the world of social business.<br>
          Prior to his transition to coaching, he worked directly with under-served populations to help individuals overcome barriers to success. Through his own journey of self-exploration and artistic expression, he discovered a profound passion to help others experience fulfillment and accomplish their goals.
